POGGERS: Portable Optimized GPU Generic Structures
__________________________________

POGGERS is a header-only library of high-performnace CUDA data structures.

This library is composed of template objects that allow you to quickly build and modify a modular table while maintaining high performance.

The end goal of the library is to add simple-to-use data structures that simplify the use of CUDA and bring a syntax similar to mainline C++.

For now, the features that are supported are the hash table and filter components.
